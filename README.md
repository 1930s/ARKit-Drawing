# ARKit-Drawing
Drawing shapes and placing objects on planes/freeform/images using ARKit. Made using
the ARKit tutorial in App Development with Swift (link below).

## How to use

Move your phone around to detect a plane or place objects in front of the camera
in freeflow. Alternatively, add images for detection in [Assests.xcassets/AR Resources.arresourcegroup](https://github.com/dandua98/ARKit-Drawing/tree/master/ARKit-Drawing/Assets.xcassets/AR%20Resources.arresourcegroup) and set either the width or height (real world dimensions)
and place objects on images. Select object/scence file from Options or undo last move, reset scene etc.
You can also drag your finger around (plane mode only) to draw multiple objects.
